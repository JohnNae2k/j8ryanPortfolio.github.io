        <h2> About Me!</h2>
        <p> My name is Jonathan Ryan and I am from Corona, California. I am currently a sophmore at the University of California, San Diego pursuing my Bachelors of Science degree. Over the last few years I have been exposed to the health care environment starting from my work as a hospice volunteer, and now a fitness trainer and shadowing student for my Kinesiology department. I always knew I'd want to work in this field and I am looking forward to future opportunities!</p>

            <h3> Workout App</h3>
            <p> I have created an app that has individualized training schedules and meal plans based on the users' personal goals and aspirations. This app allows anyone who accesses it to be able to view their personalized workouts after they answer questions pertaining to their BMI, activity levels throughout the day, and their target weight. This app not only aids with weight loss as there is information for users to maintain or gain weight. This app was created for the convenience of the user as I included recorded exercises for at-home access, allowing anybody to have a guide anywhere.  </p>

            <h3> Personal Trainer</h3>
            <p> I am a personal trainer at my local LA Fitness. This means that I am responsible for helping individuals achieve their own fitness goals through personalized workout plans and diets. I teach my clients the proper exercise techniques to ensure they are working out efficiently and safely. I am grateful to have trained and motivated 9 individuals resulting in a combined total of 200 pounds lost. </p>

            <h3> Hospice Volunteer</h3>
            <p> I have completed over 400 hours of Hospice Volunteer work, which includes training sessions, in-services, and quality improvement programs. I was fortunate to have been able to aid two units, specifically with food services to tend towards the hospice patients' and their dietary restrictions. When I finished tending to food services, I delivered emotional support to the families and patient during their time of hardship, while maintaining confidentiality. While volunteering for my local hospice center, it has allowed me to express empathy, compassion, and active listening skills that are crucial to have in the medical field.   </p>

            <h3> Shadowing Student </h3>
            <p> For over a year I have been been a shadowing student in the Kinesiology department. I followed my assigned physical therapist and watched as they assessed their patients. Throughout my time there, I have been taking notes and learning appropriate methods in aiding individuals who are recovering from injuries or healing from surgeries. Researching our body anatomy helped me understand the injury assessments and treatment planning that the physical therapist would state. </p>
